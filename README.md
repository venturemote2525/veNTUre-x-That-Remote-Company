## Models Supported

### 1. Mask R-CNN (Primary Focus)
- **Classes**: 7 Swiss food classes (fruit, vegetable, carbohydrate, protein, dairy, fat, other)
- **Backbone**: ResNet-18 (memory optimized for RTX 2060)
- **Features**: Instance segmentation with bounding boxes and masks
- **Training**: 70 epochs (23 heads-only + 47 full fine-tuning)
- **Dataset**: Swiss COCO 7-class food segmentation dataset

### 2. Depth Anything Integration
- **Purpose**: Depth estimation for portion analysis
- **Models**: Supports multiple Depth Anything variants
- **Integration**: Works with food segmentation pipeline
- **Applications**: 3D food analysis and portion estimation

## Quick Start

### Training Models

1. **Swiss 7-Class Food Segmentation (Primary)**:
   ```bash
   python src/training/train_swiss_7class.py
   ```

2. **Depth Estimation Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   # Dataset processing
   python src/training/train_depth_anything_food.py --dataset-root data/swiss_coco_7class --output-dir outputs/depth_anything --split val
   
   # Single image processing
   python src/training/train_depth_anything_food.py --single-image path/to/image.jpg --output-dir outputs/depth_anything
   ```

### Monitoring Training

Check training status and progress:
```bash
python scripts/show_status.py
```

Manage log files:
```bash
python scripts/manage_logs.py --create-links
```

## Dataset Information

### Swiss 7-Class Food Dataset (Primary)
- **Classes**: fruit, vegetable, carbohydrate, protein, dairy, fat, other (+ background)
- **Format**: COCO format with instance segmentation annotations
- **Location**: `data/swiss_coco_7class/` with `train/` and `val/` subfolders
- **Task**: Instance segmentation of food items for portion analysis

### Additional Datasets
- **Classification variants**: 5, 7, 8-class food datasets in `data/classification/`
- **COCO 5-class**: Alternative dataset format in `data/coco_5class_food_dataset/`
- **Merged datasets**: Combined datasets in `data/merged/`

## Memory Optimization

Optimized for training on RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM):

- **ResNet-18 backbone** for efficient training (can upgrade to ResNet-50 with 12GB VRAM)
- **Batch size 2-4** recommended for 12GB VRAM (increased from batch size 1)
- **Increased workers** (num_workers=2-4) for faster data loading
- **CUDA memory management** with expandable segments for stability

For maximum performance with RTX 3060:
```bash
set PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True && python src/training/train_swiss_7class.py --batch-size 4
```
